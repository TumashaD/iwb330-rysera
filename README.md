## Features

- **STL File Upload:** Customers can easily upload their STL files directly on the platform.
- **Automatic Price Estimation:** Once an STL file is uploaded, the system calculates the estimated price based on the following factors:
  - Material selection (e.g., PLA)
  - Print Quality
  - Color
- **Dynamic Price Updates:** As customers tweak print parameters (e.g., Print Quality), the price estimate updates in real-time.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile usage.
